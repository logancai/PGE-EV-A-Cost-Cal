# PGE-EV-A-Cost-Cal

This JavaScript code will parse a CSV file that is typically generated from eMotorWerk's Dashboard reports and calculate the electricity usage based on PG&E EV-A plan.

How to use
Visit the index.html page. Browse for your CSV file and press Calculate. A table is generated below. The right most column is the cost.

Features
-All the calculations are done locally on your broswer. No data is transfered. 
-Code.js is pretty easy to adapt to the current prices or schedules

What I have not tested
-Actual seasonal changes
